joe	4 hours ago	1	0	TA players claim such factor as unemployment, fear of people shopping, social distancing, and fundamental damages will cause the economy collapse. But ain't TA readers not to include all these fundamental. the difference between TA and fundamental approach is clear,but these shorts try to justify why S&P will drop to test the double bottom because of the government's artificial pump to prevent falling. It seems to me shorts are holding on to what they want to see. That ecomy must collapse based on the fundamental damage. The chart is telling me the higher high will continue to rise according to TA, so I am all in going higher next week to test and will surpass it making new highs. I saw an interview about a week ago of Akinson saying he is fully participating the recent bottom. He not the only heavy hedge fund. these guy have taken recent low positions. I believe the biggest US government pump in the market will go over the high and create new highs. Because it is Trump's political agenda to win the 2nd term. by September, new S&P high!!! More	[]	[]
JP Valadez	5 hours ago	2	0	I've had phenomenal returns by simply understanding a handful of fundamental rules in the age of monetary policy: 1. The market plummeting is caused mostly by institutional investors moving money out. The wealth gap is absolutely real. The retail investors usually liquidate as part of a cascading effect and FUD. 2. When the market plummets, there's a lag before monetary policy issues a stimulus of some sort. The faster and bigger the stimulus, in relative terms, the quicker the recovery. 3. Most of the money stays up top, why? Because major players have the most to lose, being heavily invested in equities. This includes every entity from banks and investment funds to small brokerages. Most shares are owned by institutional investors. 4. All of this money that you believe the little guy is getting through PPP is going straight to millionaire business owners, who in turn purchase equities. Think about how the big banks serviced loans requested by companies who had existing loans first (presumably to protect themselves from defaults), and second, worked top down from the largest loan request to the smallest (to service less loans, less paperwork, and higher profits from fees). The small business was ignored unless they banked at a local bank. 5. Investors, millionaires, and everyone with some sort of substantial stake in the markets, understands that this type of monetary policy can potentially drive equities to ATHs. There's just too much fake money being pumped into the markets. When the Secretary of the Treasury was a Goldman Sachs executive and holds nearly half a billion in equities, it begins to look a lot like common sense not to play the short game after a stimulus bill. 6. The volatility you experience is caused mainly by institutions taking advantage of the retail investor through short and long squeezes. Remember, they hold most of the shares. 7. Ride the wave, the trend is your friend. Money and risk management is the only thing you should worry about. Institutions can drive the price in any direction, regardless of what the news say.

BobDole	6 hours ago	5	1	Same thing happened in New York. Same in Wuhan. No doubt this is being played out in countries all over the world. The death toll is higher than reported. 100 years from now, historians and researchers will still try piecing the real estimated death toll just like they're doing with the 1918 Spanish (American - since it's believed to have started in Kansas) Flu.  But even now, you have |='n morons protesting the social distancing and lockdowns, saying everyone's fear mongering because of human stupidity. Do I see these axxholes volunteering in hospitals or disposing of the dead bodies? Of course not. Without the scientists, I have no faith in humanity. Most people are ignorant morons, so quick to denial and anger anytime they can't comprehend something.    $^GSPC $^ICIX $^DJI $^RUT More Italian mayors tell CNN their information indicates the actual death toll from coronavirus in northern Italy may be more than twice the numbers officially reported.

Agentkagent	6 hours ago	5	0	Quarter one has less than one month of shut down. Earnings for quarter one is bad enough. Wait for quarter two. In many states, shut down extends to end of May. That is two months of shut down minimum for quarter two. Go figure the earnings for quarter two. You say market anticipates. Now anticipate quarter two.	[]	[]

Ian	9 hours ago	3	0	The economy will reopen because the sad truth is that you cannot afford to keep people idle with 25,000 Billions of debt on your books. It is a paradox that the Main Street begins rioting to be released from the lockdowns and get back to work to start paying off the debt that Wall Street + FED amassed, while Wall Street folks don't mind being locked down on their yachts and private islands, lol.

Marcelo	9 hours ago	2	1	Markets will continue going up folks, any downside is to be bought, we already know how this works by now. Just inject more money into the system and boom.... problem solved. I believe a deflationary cycle would be much more damaging to American families than this stagflationary cycle. Soon to come will be a sort of crypto managed by the federal government to simplify the debasing of the dollar. GLTA	[]	[]

Joemama630	10 hours ago	3	0	Reiterating what a lot of folks have said here ... this market doesn't make sense. Apparently, the large tech companies are up the most and largely due to ETF buying... the question is whether the Fed is buying those ETFs and from my understanding that is very possible.  But here is the skinny on consumer spending. Interestingly enough ... this was posted 4/15 Wednesday - the only day the market dropped this week.  Clothing sales are down 50% for March in which the shut down was arguably at just a week or two on average and in some areas no shut down as some are not yet shut down.  Many say this is just the beginning as this shutdown is likely to continue through May - definitely through April. And there are travel destinations that are literally shut down for many months to come as they simply do not have the nearby resources to help manage a breakout of the pandemic in that area (e.g. hospitals beds, healthcare providers, ventilators, etc).

As the worlds largest asset manager, BlackRock already was managing $7 trillion for its global corporate investor-clients, along with another $20 trillion for clients through its financial risk-monitoring software (called Aladdin).

Sven	17 hours ago	1	1	After the initial panic sell-off, stocks are going up but the economy looks terrible. That is due to the fact that stock markets always anticipate. However, only time will tell whether they anticipate correctly or not. The only thing we can do is assess the risk and reward of the situation, look at the long-term likelihood that there will be more and more money in the system due to printing and budged deficits and that consequently, prices of real assets like stocks, good real estate and limited services will go up. It is key to differentiate between the short-term lock-down impacts and long-term consequences of $2 trillion yearly budged deficits, for example. It is likely that good businesses will survive and that their prices as financial assets will go up due to currency value loss. As would Buffett say, invest where you have tailwinds, even if it is inflation in this case, financial asset inflation.

Yoav	22 hours ago	2	3	CoronaVirus is not the most important subject. The irrational mass hysteria is the most important subject. As prof' Yoram Lass explained today it kills mostly very ill people and the cause of death is not CoronaVirus.

So it is not the most important case.	[]	[]
