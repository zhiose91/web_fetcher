Tyson	7 hours ago	15	2	Well after this week I'm not comfortable buying or selling this market. Way to much manipulation. Way worse now than China ever was. Some may argue buy because the Fed will never stop, but at some point something we will never hear about will go wrong and we will unexpectedly crash back to reality, but how far will it be? and how long? it's not a safe short game either simply because of the duration. I guess I will just have to start trading precious metals while it is still legal, maybe I'll get some physical too and that can be my hedge against our countries implosion. I really don't have any confidence left in gov't. right now.

There is still a-lot of damage left to be done and Trump knows it.There are now 17 million unemployed in this country. People will start defaulting on home & auto loans here soon. People are thinking about surviving at this point. They aren't thinking about buying homes, iphones, cars, nikes, and other consumer goods. Trump is a con man and has the IQ of a rock. The economy is no where near opening up at this point. Please vote him out of office in November. Worst president in US history and the data proves it! How can you defend him at this point? He said on national TV it was a Hoax and a liberal conspiracy. He downplayed and didn't take it seriously. It allowed this virus to destroy our American way of life.

If we all took a magic pill today that would cure us of or prevent us from getting COVID-19 then there will still be an ENORMOUS negative GDP growth rate this year. Fed cant fix that. This will be remembered as the most irrational exuberance in history.

Sterling	13 hours ago	2	2	Coronavirus is basically a nothingburger story and that's what the market is reacting to, along with pumping by the fed. 60,000 deaths is nothing when we priced in a million. Yet people are completely overlooking the bigger economic challenges we're facing. They think that we haven't artificially introduced sweeping ineffeciencies into an already vulnerable economy. "Stop talking about unemployment." Ok, unemployment is the tip of the iceberg, we have shortages in the most advanced economy in the world. We could be on the brink of an energy crisis thanks to our domestic producers having to fight the Saudis, Iran, Russia and our own GD government just to produce in the states. We killed coal and now oil and gas is in a dire place. What happens when we kill American agriculture and the 58 year old avg US farmer finally throws in the towel after hemorrhaging money the last three years? Do we really think we can systematically dismantle all of America's tangible production of goods with no negative effect? We are sitting on a literal mountain of corporate debt, personal debt and government debt. What's the light at the end of this tunnel?
